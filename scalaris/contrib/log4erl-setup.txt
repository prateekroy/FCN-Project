16.11.2016: download from https://github.com/ahmednawras/log4erl
1) download new version
2) remove append from FILE_OPTIONS in include/log4erl.hrl
2) add delayed_write to FILE_OPTIONS in include/log4erl.hrl to increase performance at the cost of losing log entries if the log4erl process dies
7) that's it, go back to <scalaris>/ and run ./configure && make

You probably have to patch log4erl to make the erlang/dev dialyzer happy.
